                <h2>Week 1</h2>
                <h3>Difficulties</h3>
                <p>I encountered numerous challenges while attempting to install Unity on my laptop. My goal was to
                    familiarize myself with the software within the first week,
                    but the installation process proved to be frustrating and stressful. Despite multiple
                    attempts—including restarting my laptop, uninstalling and reinstalling Unity,
                    and following ChatGPT’s troubleshooting advice—the issue persisted. Ultimately, I am not even sure
                    how I resolved it, but somehow, I managed to get it working..</p>
                <p>During this time, I was installing Unity alongside a teammate who successfully downloaded it without
                    any issues. However, while her installation proceeded smoothly, mine was plagued with persistent
                    errors in the Unity Editor.</p>
                <p>On January 29, 2025, I reached out for assistance in the Discord server, where both my instructor and
                    fellow students tried to help me troubleshoot the problem. Despite their efforts, I was only able to
                    fully set up Unity by February 5. The main issue turned out to be VPN restrictions that were
                    blocking the installation, along with a critical pop-up that appeared for only 10 seconds, requiring
                    immediate action. Once I addressed these obstacles, I was finally able to complete the setup.</p>

                    <h2>Week 2</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Our team held its first meeting on the 4th in the library, where we discussed the foundational ideas
                    for our game. Each team member shared their concepts, including one proposal for a psychological
                    narrative-driven game where players progressively unlock more of the story and shape their own world
                    based on their choices.

                    Since not everyone was familiar with one another, we took the time to introduce ourselves and
                    discuss our individual skills and preferred roles within the project. However, I personally
                    struggled with deciding on a game concept. Creativity has always been a challenge for me—I either
                    find it difficult to generate ideas or become overwhelmed with too many, making it hard to settle on
                    a single direction.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, I decided on an RPG-style game where the protagonist is thrown into a world of
                    nothingness. The game symbolizes an individual’s struggle with their own mind. The monsters
                    encountered represent psychological torment, and the player must navigate through multiple maps in
                    an attempt to improve. However, just when they believe they have overcome their struggles, they are
                    cast into darkness once again—symbolizing the harsh reality that, no matter how hard one tries,
                    success is not always guaranteed.

                    I am particularly drawn to psychological games that evoke deep emotions, challenge the player’s
                    perception, and leave them reflecting on their choices. I want to create an experience that makes
                    players think, regret, and feel—one that stays with them long after they finish playing.</p>

                <h4>Second Meeting-February 5th of February</h4>

                <p>During our second meeting on February 5th, we had an in-depth discussion about the type of game we
                    wanted to create. We brainstormed and refined our ideas, focusing on narrative structure and core
                    themes. Our initial concept centered around a main character (MC) whose story unfolds through
                    multiple scenes, each revealing a different perspective. A key element of the narrative is the
                    narrator, who controls the truth and influences how the story is perceived.</p>

                <p></p>
                <h4>Fixing Unity Installation</h4>
                <p>On Wednesday, I was finally able to resolve the Unity installation issue. The problem stemmed from
                    pop-up prompts that appeared during the installation process, requiring me to select "Yes" or "No"
                    within a 10-second window. Since I had previously missed these prompts, the installation would fail
                    each time. My instructor identified this issue and advised me to keep my eyes on the screen at all
                    times. Following his guidance, we successfully installed Unity, allowing me to begin the Flappy Bird
                    tutorial, which had been recommended by our teacher.</p>
                <h4>Challenges with Learning Unity</h4>
                <p>One of my biggest challenges was focusing on a single tutorial at a time. I wanted to explore
                    multiple approaches and gain a broad understanding of different game mechanics and methods. This led
                    to difficulty in choosing which tutorial to follow, as I often found myself switching between
                    resources. To address this, I decided to follow a tutorial while simultaneously researching
                    solutions independently, using the Unity Documentation and other sources.</p>
                <p>Despite my efforts, I encountered several conceptual challenges, particularly in understanding:</p>
                <p>Vectors (Vector2 vs. Vector3)</p>
                <p>Transforms and object positioning</p>
                <p>nput handling methods</p>
                <p>Through research, I discovered that Vector2 represents x and y coordinates, while Vector3
                    incorporates x, y, and z. Additionally, I learned that Input.GetAxis provides smoother movement than
                    Input.GetKey since it allows players to use both WASD and arrow keys while offering gradual
                    acceleration and deceleration.</p>

                <h4>Friday Meeting – Act 2 Planning</h4>
                <p>On Friday, we held another team meeting, this time at the Kenny Business Center, to refine our plans
                    for Act 2 of the game. Since we had not yet finalized its structure, we discussed potential gameplay
                    elements and made several adjustments.

                    Act 2 is centered around the library, where the main character works as an assistant to the head
                    librarian. The MC interacts with both a scribe and a librarian, engaging in random conversations
                    that gradually reveal key story details. The core gameplay involves completing two to three tasks,
                    including:

                    Sorting books by initials

                    Checking in books

                    Uncovering a hidden book, which their past self seemingly knew about

                    We brainstormed additional task ideas, with suggestions including repairing broken glass and other
                    interactive puzzles. While we did not finalize all elements of Act 2, the discussion helped us m</p>

                    <h2>Week 3</h2>
                </header>

                <p>On Monday (5-6 PM), our team met to discuss our project in greater detail. After careful
                    consideration, we decided to switch from Unity to Unreal Engine due to its superior graphics,
                    built-in features, and Blueprint system, which allows beginners to create complex games without
                    coding. Initially, I was hesitant about switching, as I had become more comfortable with Unity.
                    However, after watching more tutorials, I became intrigued by Unreal Engine’s capabilities and
                    wanted to explore it further.

                    I recognize that learning Unreal will take longer, as I plan to understand Blueprints first before
                    transitioning to C++. I believe this approach will help me grasp gameplay mechanics more thoroughly.
                    Additionally, Unreal allows for a hybrid workflow, integrating both Blueprints and C++, which is
                    highly beneficial.

                    During the meeting, we also discussed suitable meeting times. The team leader suggested that
                    everyone should at least complete a 2D tutorial in Unreal by Wednesday to get familiar with the
                    engine. Monday and Friday meetings were made mandatory, with a proposed Monday 9 AM lab session
                    since most of us are available then. We anticipated that fewer people would attend this session,
                    making it an ideal time for focused work. Our Friday meetings were scheduled for 12-1 PM.

                    Another key discussion point was assigning roles within the team. One member broke down the gameplay
                    mechanics, and I took notes to ensure I fully understood our project’s direction. Although my
                    primary role is coding, I believe understanding the overall game design will help me develop better
                    solutions for potential challenges. I always make it a priority to attend team meetings, as taking
                    my own notes significantly enhances my comprehension.

                    I planned to install Unreal Engine and go through several tutorials to familiarize myself with the
                    software.

                    ﻿
                    I decided to follow Cobra code 2D tutorial.Where I followed along with the different nodes related
                    to movement and more.</p>
                <h4>Challenges with Installing Unreal Engine</h4>
                <p>Installing Unreal proved to be a significant challenge. The download remained stuck at the same
                    percentage for extended periods. I tried to be patient, waiting two hours in hopes that it would at
                    least reach the halfway mark. However, after four hours, it was still at 4%.

                    In an attempt to speed up the process, I searched for other available laptops in the library, but
                    downloading Unreal required administrative access, which I didn’t have. By 7 PM, I decided to leave
                    it running and head home. The installation finally completed between 9 PM and 4 AM.

                    Frustrated with the delay, I chose to study Unreal Engine concepts and game mechanics while waiting.
                    Once the installation was complete, I immediately began watching tutorials. My main challenge was
                    choosing the right tutorial—I ultimately selected Cobra Code’s 2D Unreal tutorial, as he is also an
                    Unreal Engine instructor on Udemy. However, I decided against purchasing the full course, as it
                    primarily focused on Blueprints rather than C++ integration, which is crucial for our project.
                    Additionally, since I am only using Unreal for this semester, I didn’t find it worthwhile to invest
                    in a course that wasn’t discounted</p>
                <h4>Learning Unreal and Balancing Priorities</h4>
                <p>wrong.

                    Another challenge I encountered was that, despite following the tutorial, I could not get the
                    character to move, regardless of how many times I attempted to implement it. I rewatched the
                    tutorial to identify my mistake. When I sought guidance from the instructor, he advised me to review
                    the videos again, explaining that I had been deviating from the intended approach by trying to
                    implement my own methods—which ultimately proved counterproductive. Consequently, I revisited the
                    tutorial to pinpoint where I went wrong.

                    Balancing Unreal with midterm studies is proving to be a challenge. My primary focus right now is
                    understanding Unreal Engine, but I recognize that I cannot make it my sole priority. I hope to find
                    a way to effectively manage both my coursework and game development responsibilities in the coming
                    weeks.

                    Unfortunately, I did not make significant progress because I was focused on resolving several
                    issues. I plan to compensate for the lost time by dedicating more effort to game development this
                    weekend and throughout the coming week. In the meantime, I have shifted my focus to an alternative
                    Cobra tutorial that utilizes Unreal Engine 5.0. I was initially hoping to continue with Unity and
                    truly wish we had remained with it.</p>

                <h2>Week 4</h2>
                <h3>Asked my team to switch from Unreal to Unity</h3>
                <p>After a lot of consideration, I decided that doing Unity instead of Unreal had more benefits.</p>
                <p>Here,I started understanding C# and following unity tutorials, so my memory of it will come back.I ws
                    contemplating buying a unity course on Udemy, then I realized that it was a waste of money, if I am
                    not going into games development in second year.</p>

                <h4>Gave roles to coders</h4>

                <p>On friday I,the head coder Diana gave the different coding roles such as Ui developer, painting scene
                    developer, narration developer and gameplay developer to the coders.I broke down the roles so the
                    coders will understand what they need to do.I used information from my notes in order to make this
                    happen.We talked about the individual roles not in detail just a summary.
