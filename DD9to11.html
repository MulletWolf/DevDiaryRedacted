                <p>When I was trying to set up the scene tutorial, I made errors such as  this:

                    I was confused since I was following the tutorial, and it said to go to Build settings, but there were only build profiles, not a build setting. I realized that the problem was I was using the file path, not the name of the scene. After I changed it, there were no errors. I searched online and on YouTube to understand what the difference was, then I realized that build profiles were an improved version of Build settings. I also had errors, such as 2d assets refusing to show in the scene, but they show in game, but my other teammates it works fine for them. </p>

                <H3>My goal</H3>
                <p>My goal was to create a transition of scenes,hence why I used an array, since I want a specific order on which scene comes first.I looked at videos on dialogue, then after a few hrs I realized I shouldn't focus on it, since 2 ppl jobs were based off it.I just wanted some understanding.I learnt things such as SceneManager,IEnumerator,AsyncOperation and coroutine.I used videos such a s “Unity scene transitions in 443 seconds”, “How to make scene transition in Unity” etc.
                </p>
                <p>I was working on the ProgressManager script,I want it to have a method that checks if something has been unlocked already and if it hasn't it unlocks it.Another method that checks what happens when the cipher is unlocked and clicked(added to inventory) and what happens when the painting is unlocked and clicked(the gallery scene is loaded).I want this method to be about what goes on inside each scene .I wanted a different method to focus on the different painting that acts as transitions into different scenes within the gallery (UnlockSceneInGallery).This method basically checks if the scene is unlocked (when the cipher and painting of the previous scene has been unlocked) then you can then transition to the next scene. I wanted to use a method called CheckStatusAndUnlock to check if the painting has been unlocked yet if not return it unlocked if so unlock it. I was wondering how I could make it so individual scenes can be unlocked one at a time. I realized I can just use a switch statement of the different scenes that need unlocking and call each scene as a scene Index in an array.
                </p>
                <h5>29/03/2025</h5>
                <p>I experienced a challenging moment while working on my project. Despite following multiple tutorials, including one from two years ago, I encountered persistent issues. I added numerous Debug.Log statements to track key parts of the code, but the spacebar press wasn't being registered to trigger scene transitions. After two days of frustration, I decided to simplify my approach. I discarded the complex setup with async operations, while loops, and if statements, and instead created a basic system where the current index simply increases with each update. This approach worked.

                    This experience taught me an important lesson: rather than following tutorials to the letter, it's essential to fully understand the code and leverage resources like the Unity documentation to solve problems effectively.</p>
                <p> I used a different unity project for experimenting so i don't end up coming with any errors cuz of other code. I tried to do fading scene, I first tried from a unity tutorial, did not work, i looked up online and tried to use boolean statements and changing the alpha of canvas, did not work, i tried to use animation, did not work.I gave up so on monday i'm going to ask the teacher to help me out
                </p>
                
                <h5>31/03/2025</h5>
                <p>Decided to give up on the fading scene and just focus on completing the tasks. I decided to break the code down and finish anything that's related to unlock when progress bar is full, which i'm going to put inside the progress manager.</p>
                <p>I tried to fix my clicking system. I used raycast before and it worked, but now it doesn't work. I just decided to stick with box collision and OnMouseEnter,which makes life easier.
                </p>
                <P>The use of Enums was recommended to me by my lecturer</P>
                <p>I told the teacher I was struggling with the crossfade, and he suggested I focus on other tasks. During Thursday's meeting, I was fixing some code related to clicking items. I was using raycasting, but it wasn’t registering clicks. I went to my Games Modelling lecturer, who suggested using enums instead of multiple if statements. After learning about enums through tutorials, I decided to stick with my current approach and focus on making the debug logs work. I also asked the lecturer if it's okay to use raycasts while my teammate used box colliders, and he recommended we use the same method. I added more debug logs to better track the process.

                    With the lecturer’s help, I fixed the clicking issue—it turned out the problem was that my camera was set to perspective mode. After some trial and error with the debug logs, I fixed it.</p>
          <p>Saturday
              I debugged my code to check what’s working. I found that the issue isn't with the code itself, but with how the debug logs are behaving. The paintings and ciphers are automatically set to unlockable = true, which isn’t what I want. Another issue is that when I click on a cherry, it also triggers the cipher, and after clicking the cherry, nothing happens when I click on the cipher.

              I’ve been reviewing my code to ensure there are no duplicate debug statements causing the issue. I also changed the OnClick to return a string, so when a game object is clicked, the string can be used in the progress manager. For example, when Painting1 is clicked, it’ll take the player to scene 4 (the gallery).

              My goal is for the gems to be locked until the progress bar is full, at which point they will unlock. I updated the code to check if the game object’s name contains a specific word and return that string for use in other methods.</p>

               <p>

                   The lecturer messaged me offering to add another person to the team, and I agreed for extra help. I needed assistance with errors and adding music, as well as animations if needed. We met in the Games Modelling lab on Thursday, where I helped a teammate install Unity and GitHub. I explained the game concept, the repo structure, and my current issues. Gavin advised me to write down my problems to make them clearer, as my previous explanations weren’t effective.</p>

                 
                <p>  I found that clicking the cherry also triggered the cipher, and now I need to make sure the gems stay locked until all cherries are clicked and the progress bar is full. I’m also facing an issue where clicking gems only triggers the "no item hit" debug.

                    My teammate suggested I remove duplicate code, which could be causing the issue. We’re now going through the code to fix the problem.</p>
                
                <p><p>I uploaded the music files to the correct folder in GitHub so the team member working on the music can easily find them. I updated the file path in GitHub and told my new teammate to focus on adding the sound files created by the Producer to the scenes. </p>

                <p>During a team meeting, I explained to my teammates that they needed to install GitHub Desktop to pull changes into their local repositories. </p>
                </p>
                <p>

                    I helped the new teammate set up audio in the scene. She struggled with GitHub at first, needing guidance, but improved her communication and research skills after being assigned the audio task. There wasn’t much else for her to do since most of the code was already complete.</p>
                
                <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>
                <img alt="" data-position="center center" src="images/E2.png"/>
                <p>I fixed an issue where clicking the gem said it was both locked and unlocked—it was due to checking unlock status too early. I also accidentally reset progress to 0 after it was full, which I corrected by handling the check and unlock logic in the same method triggered on click.</p>

                <p>I switched from raycast to <code>OnMouseDown</code>, which fixed the cipher unlocking when clicking cherries(cipher unlocks once all cherries are clicked).I used cherries as a placeholder for tasks. I also found duplicate debug logs and unlock logic in multiple methods, so I organized the code and created a dedicated unlock method.</p>

                <p>Now, cipher1 unlocks correctly after cherries are clicked, but still shows "unlocked" too early if clicked first. Painting1 currently does nothing when clicked. I decided to apply same code from cipher1 to the Painting1 to fix teh problem.</p>




                <p>I fixed the issue with the painting not unlocking. The problem was caused by calling <code>OnItemClick</code> within <code>HandleUnlockables</code>, and vice versa, leading to a stack overflow. I resolved it by removing the redundant call.</p>
                <p>When I tried to call the method that handles what happens once an item is unlocked(HandleUnlockables), it says null. I just directly put the change of scenes if a painting was clicked, and the cipher is added to the inventory once the cipher is clicked (when the progressbar is full).</p>
                <p>I decided to add boolean values .so it will properly track when painting is clicked and its unlocked then go to next scene.it prevents any errors from happening.I made all the game objects that i will need in a scene as prefabs so i don't have to repeatedly refer scripts.</p>

               <h3>More Problems</h3>
<!--                <img alt="" data-position="center center" src="images/UnitySwitch.png"/>-->
                <P>The item clicking, cipher unlocks, and painting unlocks are now working. When a painting is unlocked and clicked, it successfully brings you to the gallery scene.

                    Now I'm working on making sure that, when you click on a painting in the gallery, and it's unlocked, it brings you to the next scene.

                    The rabbits currently point to Painting 3 — it's just a placeholder, not the final product.</P>

                <img alt="" data-position="center center" src="images/E5.png"/>
                <p>Other problem.When I am In the gallery with the 3 paintings,it doesn't bring me to the scene.I realized that it could be because I have the same painting name for the ones inside the painting and the ones in the gallery.So I should increase the itemDictionary to have 3 more paintings
                </p>
                <img alt="" data-position="center center" src="images/E7.png"/>
                
                <p> I made sure all the code works and there's no errors.It does work, it's just that when I click a painting inside the gallery, it doesn't bring you to a different scene.I have a method called UnlockSceneInGallery which checks if a painting is unlocked and ts clicked then it brings you to the correct scene.I tried using a dictionary for fast lookup, but I feel that it's better to keep things simple and straightforward.</p>

                <h4>Gave roles to coders</h4>

                <p>On friday I,the head coder Diana gave the different coding roles such as Ui developer, painting scene
                    developer, narration developer and gameplay developer to the coders.I broke down the roles so the
                    coders will understand what they need to do.I used information from my notes in order to make this
                    happen.We talked about the individual roles not in detail just a summary.
